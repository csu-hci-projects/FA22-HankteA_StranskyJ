Using Standard VR controls:

Left stick changes camera/player direction
Right stick for movement

Both left and right controllers have the ability to grab knifes.

Throwing a knife is similar to throwing in real life, the momentum to carry the 
knife will be determined in part by your velocity when releasing the knife.
